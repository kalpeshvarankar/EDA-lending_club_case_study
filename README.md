## General Information
- Lending clubs is a financial company that lends unsecured loans to customers who are looking for any kind of loan. But lending money to any customer is risky as he might not pay back the loan and get defaulted which will prove as a huge financial loss.
- So, the major problem that the lending club faces is to whom should they lend money and to whom should they not. Approving loans to customers who might not pay back the money is a financial loss and not approving loans to good customers who are likely to pay back all the money in time will be a business loss.
- The dataset that is been used in this analysis contains information about past loan applicants and whether they defaulted or not.
